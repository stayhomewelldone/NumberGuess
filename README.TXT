Number Guessing Game - "Gokje"

Welcome to the "Gokje" Number Guessing Game! This is a Java console-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 16. Players have 10 chances to make the correct guess and win the game. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether the guess was correct or not, along with the number of remaining attempts.

To play the game, follow these steps:

    Compile and Run:
        Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
        Compile the Gokje.java file using the command: javac Gokje.java
        Run the compiled program using: java Gokje

    Guessing the Number:
        Once the game starts, you'll receive a warm welcome message and instructions.
        Enter your guess between 0 and 16 in response to the prompts.
        The game will inform you whether your guess was correct or not.
        You have a total of 10 attempts to guess correctly.

    Winning and Replay:
        If you guess the correct number, you win!
        After each round, you'll be asked if you want to play again.
        Enter "ja" (yes) to play another round or "nee" (no) to exit the game.

Please note:

    The game uses Java's JOptionPane for input and output interaction, so make sure your system supports graphical dialogs.
    The game generates a random target number each round, so each game is unique.
    Enjoy the challenge of trying to guess the correct number within the given attempts!
